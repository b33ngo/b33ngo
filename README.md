### Welcome there ðŸ‘‹

I'm blockchain enthusiast and crazy about mathematic, cryptography and interesting problems. You can try to solve [one](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/22) especially if you like polynomials.

If you want a gift from me, then write to my secret protonmail account. This hash will help you find it: **c4a2a678a0d55bf3231593381a0fe203**.

Most of my works are under NDA. But new open-source projects are coming.
